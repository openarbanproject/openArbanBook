# openArbanBook
A recreation of Arban's Cornet Method
This is the primary goal of the project at this time. Until there are more collaborators then it is not expected to be completed any time soon...

You can download a copy of the Open Arban Book in PDF format, as it is right now, from the [Neoteric Brass Website](https://neotericbrass.com/downloads/openarbanbook/).
Be aware that the book is incomplete and may also contain errors, feel free to let me know what you find or make a PR!
