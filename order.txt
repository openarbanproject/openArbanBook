I think pretty soon it's going to be necessary to keep an eye on the order of
all of these PDFs we're creating so that when we eventually put a book together
it's not going to be too hard to remember. The reason this is important is that
already I've written out the section that has a title "Syncopation" and it
started with an exercise numbered "1". The next part of the book is exercises
"with a dotted eighth note followed by a sixteeth note" and that continues from
exercise "13". It then goes into another group of exercises that aren't
labelled at all but carry on the same set of numbers... Hence the necessity of
this file! Names on this list should match folder names and stated the 
numbering of the exercises in that folder.

Initial Exercises (01-50)

Sycopation (01-12)
Dotted Rhythms (13-18)
Fanfare Rhythm (19-27)
Compound-Duple-Time (28-38)

Legato (01-69)

Intervals (01-12)

Characteristic Studies (01-12)
