**README**

Most of the openArbanBook has been transcribed from the earliest English language version that is commonly available.
Although this is also an edited version, it was decided in the beginning of this project that it would be the most 
authentic starting point. However, it appears that the versions of the Characteristic Studies that are published in
this version of the book have big sections missing compared to the modern editions.

Seeing as it doesn't really make sense to release copies of the studies that are not as people would wish to study 
them in modern times the next decision to be made is which version to use. I'll deal with this in due course as these
studies are the part of the book that I wish to complete next and update this file in case anybody wishes to contribute.

For now at least I would use any modern version with the knowledge that we may need to edit articulations in future for
consistency or alignment with a public domain copy of the book. We need to be sure not to be violating copyright of
current editions of the book - that's the entire purpose of this project! It may, in fact, be better to release the
most generic versions of these studies as possible to encourage students and performers to interpret the work for themselves.

Remember that the primary goal of oAP is to create files that people can freely copy, edit and share - this is the best way
to make sure that sheet music that should be free of charge is easily available and a better option than pirating a copyrighted 
version of the book. These currently copyrighted versions have no right or valuable merit to justify the charging of money 
for the historical knowledge pertaining to our art.
